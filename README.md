# OpenWebMonitor – The FOSS Web Change Tracker 🚀

## Project Overview

OpenWebMonitor is an open-source, self-hosted web page tracking tool that allows users to monitor changes on any webpage and receive real-time alerts. It provides a privacy-friendly alternative to proprietary services like Distill.io and Visualping, helping users track updates for price changes, blog posts, government notices, stock updates, and more.

By leveraging Next.js, Puppeteer, Supabase, and TailwindCSS, OpenWebMonitor ensures an efficient, scalable, and cost-effective solution for web tracking needs.

## Problem Statement & Need for OpenWebMonitor

Many users need to track changes on websites, such as:

- Researchers & Journalists tracking policy updates.
- E-commerce shoppers monitoring price drops.
- Students & professionals keeping up with exam results or job listings.
- Businesses tracking competitors’ updates.

Existing solutions (Distill.io, Visualping) are paid & proprietary 🚫. OpenWebMonitor provides a FOSS alternative, ensuring:
- **Privacy** – No user data tracking.
- **Free & self-hosted** – No expensive subscriptions.
- **Customizable** – Users can define tracking frequency & notification methods.

## Features & Tech Stack

### Core Features

- **Track Changes on Any Webpage** – Detects text, HTML, or element updates.
- **Custom Tracking Frequency** – Users choose update intervals (10 mins, hourly, daily).
- **Real-time Notifications** – Alerts via email, in-app, or webhook integration.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard** – Modern UI for managing tracked pages.
- **Fully Open-Source & Self-Hosted** – No vendor lock-in.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend** → Next.js (React SSR for fast UI)
- **Backend** → Node.js + Puppeteer (Web scraping & automation)
- **Database** → Supabase (PostgreSQL for storing tracked data)
- **Styling** → TailwindCSS (Modern UI)
- **Notifications** → Supabase Functions / WebSockets (for alerts)

## Scalability & Future Improvements

### Scalability Considerations

- **Distributed Monitoring** – Can be deployed across multiple servers to track thousands of pages.
- **Optimized Scraping** – Uses Puppeteer efficiently to reduce memory & CPU usage.
- **Cloud-Ready** – Can be hosted on Vercel, Netlify, or self-hosted with Docker.
- **Database Optimization** – Supabase (PostgreSQL) ensures fast query performance.

### Future Enhancements

- **AI-Based Change Summarization** – Extract and summarize meaningful updates.
- **Browser Extension** – One-click tracking for Chrome/Firefox.
- **Export Logs** – Users can download tracking history.
- **Community Plugins** – Allow users to extend functionality.

## Monetization Strategies (If Converted into a SaaS Model)

Though OpenWebMonitor is FOSS, monetization is possible:
- **Hosted SaaS Version** – Provide a managed hosting service with premium features.
- **Freemium Model** – Offer free basic tracking with paid advanced features (e.g., more frequent checks).
- **Enterprise Solutions** – Custom deployments for businesses.
- **Donations & Sponsorships** – Open-source contributors often fund valuable projects.
